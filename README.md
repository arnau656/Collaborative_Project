Our project consists of a website which is based on a law firm specialized in family matters.

The page consists of a main page which is called "home". Within this page we can see a small 
description of the site. It also consists of another page called "about us", which should contain 
information about the law firm. we have another section called "practices" in which we can see the 
services that lawyers can provide us. Within "our lawyers" we can see the lawyers available to the page.
News does not exist. The "contact" page contains some fields to fill in to be able to contact the 
administrators of the page.

Parts made by each one:

Arnau: ABOUT and OUR LAWYERS
Adri: PRACTICES and CONTACT
Between the two we have done the HOME (because neither of us finished having it complete), the header and footer.

The libraries created are:

-Layout: within which we have the design of the footer (footer.html) and header 
(header.html) that will help us load them once we enter the main pages

-scss: contains 3 scss
  -Variables: it contains the variables of the colors that we will use in the page and the source
  -Custom: overwrite bootstrap classes
  -Style: change css style
  
-Then we have inside the main folder: tenim: about.html, contact.html, index.html, 
our_lawyers.html, post1.html, post2.html, post3.html, practices.html and script.js 
(script that will load the header and footer)
